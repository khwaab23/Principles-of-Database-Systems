# Principles of Database Systems (CS-GY 6083)

This repository contains coursework, assignments, and project materials for the *Principles of Database Systems* course taken during Fall 2024 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The course, led by Prof. Phyllis Frankl, provides a comprehensive introduction to relational database systems, focusing on design, implementation, and optimization techniques.

---

## 📚 Course Description
The *Principles of Database Systems* course covers foundational and advanced concepts in database systems. Topics include:
- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- Relational algebra and calculus
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Indexing methods (e.g., B+ Trees and hashing)
- Query processing and optimization
- Transaction management, including ACID properties and concurrency control
- Design and implementation of web-based database applications

Students learn to design robust databases, write complex queries, and develop practical web applications using MySQL and Python (Flask). The coursework involves theoretical assignments, programming tasks, and a multi-phase team project.
